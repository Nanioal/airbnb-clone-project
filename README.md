## 🔐 API Security

Security is a foundational aspect of the Airbnb Clone backend. Protecting user data, securing financial transactions, and preventing abuse are critical for maintaining trust and system integrity.

---

### 🧾 Authentication

**What It Is:**  
Verifies the identity of users accessing the system.

**Implementation:**  
- Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth2)
- Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
- Multi-factor authentication (optional for hosts or admins)

**Why It Matters:**  
Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data, ensuring only verified users can interact with the platform.

---

### 🛂 Authorization

**What It Is:**  
Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do.

**Implementation:**  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for guests, hosts, and admins
- Endpoint-level permission checks (e.g., only hosts can modify their properties)

**Why It Matters:**  
Ensures users can only perform actions they’re permitted to—e.g., a guest shouldn’t be able to delete another host’s property.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

**What It Is:**  
Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time frame.

**Implementation:**  
- Throttling via Django REST Framework or middleware
- IP-based or token-based limits

**Why It Matters:**  
Protects the API from abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts, ensuring stable performance for all users.

---

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization

**What It Is:**  
Ensures all incoming data is clean, safe, and conforms to expected formats.

**Implementation:**  
- Field-level validation in serializers
- Escaping user input to prevent injection attacks

**Why It Matters:**  
Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and malformed data that could compromise the system.

---

### 🔒 Secure Payments

**What It Is:**  
Protects financial transactions and sensitive payment information.

**Implementation:**  
- Integration with trusted payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- HTTPS encryption for all payment-related endpoints
- Tokenization of payment data

**Why It Matters:**  
Ensures user trust and compliance with financial regulations by safeguarding payment details and preventing fraud.

---

### 🧠 Session & Token Management

**What It Is:**  
Manages user sessions securely and prevents token misuse.

**Implementation:**  
- Expiry and refresh mechanisms for tokens
- Revocation of tokens on logout or suspicious activity
- Redis-backed session storage for scalability

**Why It Matters:**  
Prevents session hijacking and ensures users remain securely authenticated across interactions.
